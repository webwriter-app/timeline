                The first written evidence of the official Games dates from 776 BC, when the Greeks began measuring time
                in Olympiads, or the duration between each edition of the Olympic Games. The first Olympic Games were
                held every four years in honour of the god Zeus. From then on, a number of artistic activities such as
                music, singing, poetry and theatre were organised at the Pythian or Delphic Games (a separate event to
                the Games held in Olympia), linking culture and sport right from the beginning of the Games.

        <webwriter-timeline-event-details>
            <p>
                In 393 AD, the Roman Emperor Theodosius I banned the Olympic Games for religious reasons, claiming that
                they encouraged paganism. They were not revived until the modern era.

        <webwriter-timeline-event-details>
            <p>
                A number of initiatives to re-establish an international sporting event were attempted at the end of the
                19th century, but failed due to the lack of coordination among the worldwide sporting movement - until
                one man decided to bring the main stakeholders together in Paris.

            <p>
                The Olympic Games were therefore revived at the first Olympic Congress, organised by Baron Pierre de
                Coubertin and held at the Grand Amphitheatre at the Sorbonne University from 16 to 23 June 1894. Two
                thousand people attended, including 58 French delegates representing 24 sports organisations and clubs,
                and 20 delegates from Belgium, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden and the
                United States representing 13 foreign sports federations.

                The Paris 1900 Olympic Games saw women compete for the first time. The first female Olympic champion was
                Charlotte Cooper, a British tennis player who won Wimbledon five times. Out of a total of 997 athletes,
                22 were women, competing in just five sports:
